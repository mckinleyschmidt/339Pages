Hello there! This is my website dedicated to the subject of clowns. Clowns seem to get a bad rep, and many people have deep fears of them. But I think they're misunderstood. The appeal of clowns to me is the artistry in their costumes and makeup, as well as their passion to entertain. On here, you can learn about the evolution of clowns, the many different types of clowns and take a look at my own clown collection! Enjoy!

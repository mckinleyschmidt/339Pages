History of Clowns

Although the term "clown" did not come about until the 16th century, there has been a long history of fools and funnypeople specially appointed by royalty as far back as Ancient Egypt. Dangas would dress in leopard skins and masks and entertain Pharohs by imitating Egyptian gods. Ancient Greece and Rome had clown-like figures that would perform in plays. One well known clown, Stupidus, was regarded for his satirical commentary of current events of the time.

In the Middle Ages, court jesters were professional performers who delighted in taking jabs at the royal class. Despite this, they were loved by kings and commoners alike. In Italy, the Commedia delâ€™arte featured many humorous stock characters, the most popular being Harlequin and Pierrot. Perhaps the most influential figure to modern clowns today is Joseph Grimaldi. Grimaldi was the originator of the clown image we all know today: stark white face, red cheeks and exaggerated facial figures. Because of his legacy, clowns are sometimes also known as "Joey's".

In more contemporary times, the "Tramp" or "Hobo" clown came about in the 1930s to reflect the struggles of the Great Depression. Emmett Kelly and Charlie Chaplin were known for their hobo/tramp characters. An international organization for clowns even exists, International Circus Clowns Club started in the 1940s by Stan Bult and clowns at London's Olympia.

Today, clowns have a more negative image. Although there isn't an official phobia for clowns, many people have a deep fear or discomfort of them. Where did this come from? Some believe it started with the troubled lives of the people who portrayed clowns. Although Joseph Grimaldi was well loved. his real life was full of trauma and pain, both physical and mental. It made onlookers begin to think about who the real person was under the mask. The highly publicized murders of John Wayne Gacy, whose profession was entertaining young people as Pogo the clown, I believe caused a major shift in the public's perception of clowns. Films such as Stephen King's It followed this trend of the evil clown. These depictions have no doubt hurt the careers of aspiring clowns, who want nothing more than to spread joy. I don't believe the scary clown trope will go away anytime soon, but I don't think that the innocent, fun-loving clowns will cease to bring laughs.
